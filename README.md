# Fervoare CMS

A tiny content management system

## Getting started

Assuming you have installed an Apache server on your machine, navigate to your `www` folder and run the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/stephino/fervoare .
```

Fervoare CMS comes with a 1-click installer so all you need to do is to create a MySQL database.

## Quick demo

You can access this [static DEMO](https://stephino.github.io/fervoare/) for a very short introduction to the CMS or
you can navigate to the following address:

```
http://localhost
```

## An OctoMS project

Extending the design and user roles is easy with the MVC architecture of [OctoMS](https://github.com/Stephino/octoms).

**Warning!**

Do not use this CMS in a production environment; this is an unmaintained study/side-project from 2012.
